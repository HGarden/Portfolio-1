              I have been working on this project during the first year slowly
              working up my skills and slowly adding more of what i have learned
              during this year. I started of with the desgn then the html and
              css then javascript and finally wordpress rest API

            <p>
              On this project i was to create a website for a community science
              museum in HTML and CSS. No javascript in this one as we had yet to
              learn any javascript at the project time.

            <p>
              The last big project of the year, the project exam is where we
              were supposed to use everything we had learned so far and so it
              includes everything from HTML, CSS, Javascript and Wordpress. On
              this project i really got to test my knowledge as i had to create
              a carousel and use Wordpress Rest API.
